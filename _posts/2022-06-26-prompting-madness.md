> [AI] is not a mirror, and it is not a parrot — [Joanna J. Bryson][sentience-and-sensibility]

Text-to-image generators are deep learning, neural network models that create images based on natural language prompts. These generators (such as [DALL·E 2][DALLE2], [Midjourney][midjourney], and [IMAGEN][imagen]) are now able to construct novel, credible photograph- and painting-like images. As computer vision algorithms, these tools are built by training them on millions or billions of pairs of images and text descriptions.

An ethical concern with text-to-image generators is that they "[reflect social stereotypes, oppressive viewpoints, and derogatory, or otherwise harmful, associations to marginalized identity groups][saharia-norouzi]". This project explores similar concerns for the representation of mental health, mental disorders, and neurodivergence in AI-generated imagery. At the same time, it looks into how disruptions of the human psyche have been depicted through art.

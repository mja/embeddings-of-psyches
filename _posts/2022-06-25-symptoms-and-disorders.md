My first explorations of how mental illness was expressed in Midjourney was drawn from my [work in psychiatric genetics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-mark-james-adams), so created prompts like "[a gene for depression][gene-for-mdd]".  Prompts with "a gene for \[X\]" for "[bipolar disorder][gene-for-bip]", "[anxiety][gene-for-anx]", "[schizophrenia][gene-for-scz]" produced stereotyped images, indicating core biases in the training data and model, and didn't give rise to any new thoughts or emotions (as one wishes art to do).

I asked on the Midjourney discord if there were any ethicists or artists working in this space, and a few users chimed in that they had been using prompts like "the personification of…" or "the abstraction of…" to see what Midjourney would produce. I tried the prompt "the abstraction of depression" which produced:

!['the abstraction of depression' generated by Midjourney](https://storage.googleapis.com/dream-machines-output/bf27cde4-1961-4b01-8188-588e028b8577/grid_0.png)

I was particularly drawn to the fourth image and asked Midjourney to produce variations:

!['the abstraction of depression' variations generated by Midjourney](https://storage.googleapis.com/dream-machines-output/2cc70aa1-15ea-409f-8fa6-b28cb3b5a033/grid_0.png)

I didn't like any of these as much as the original, so I went back and upscaled it:


{% assign abstraction = site.midjourney | where: "job_id", "d5629910-9871-43b2-9494-b8062266438f" %}
<p><a href="{{ abstraction[0].url }}"><img src="{{ abstraction[0].image }}" alt="{{ abstraction[0].prompt }}" width=512 height=512/></a></p>

The resulting image had a painterly look, possibly from interpreting the "abstraction of" as "[abstract art][abstract]", put it also had the feeling of a figure sitting in an art gallery or museum. This led me to prompt Midjourney to generate images for the [history of mental illness in art][illness-in-art] by appending the phrase "in the history of art".

My first explorations of how mental illness is expressed in Midjourney were drawn from my [work in psychiatric genetics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-mark-james-adams), so I precipitated prompts like "[a gene for depression][gene-for-mdd]".  Prompts with "a gene for \[X\]" for "[bipolar disorder][gene-for-bip]", "[anxiety][gene-for-anx]", "[schizophrenia][gene-for-scz]" produced stereotyped images, indicating core biases in the training data and model, and did not give rise to any new thoughts or emotions (as one wishes art to do). As Midjourney is in beta, I won't review this material yet. 

I asked on the Midjourney Discord if there were any ethicists or artists working in this space, and a few users chimed in that they had been using prompts like "the personification of…" or "the abstraction of…" to see what Midjourney would produce. I tried the prompt "the abstraction of depression" which rendered:

!['the abstraction of depression' generated by Midjourney](https://storage.googleapis.com/dream-machines-output/bf27cde4-1961-4b01-8188-588e028b8577/grid_0.png)

I was drawn to the fourth image and asked Midjourney to produce variations:

!['the abstraction of depression' variations generated by Midjourney](https://storage.googleapis.com/dream-machines-output/2cc70aa1-15ea-409f-8fa6-b28cb3b5a033/grid_0.png)

I didn't like any of these as much as the original, so I went back and upscaled it:

{% assign abstraction = site.midjourney | where: "job_id", "d5629910-9871-43b2-9494-b8062266438f" %}
<p><a href="{{ abstraction[0].url }}"><img src="{{ abstraction[0].image }}" alt="{{ abstraction[0].prompt }}"/></a></p>

The resulting image had a painterly look, perhaps from interpreting the "abstraction of" as "[abstract art][abstract]", but it had the feeling of a figure sitting in an art gallery or museum. This led me to prompt Midjourney to generate images inspired by the [history of mental illness in art][illness-in-art] by appending the phrase "in the history of art":

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dream-machines-output/55c36f4a-f702-42c1-a70a-ddbe69a96486/grid_0.png" width="50%" height="50%"/><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dream-machines-output/3458094a-8e80-4cfe-af59-399d6fbabbc9/grid_0.png" width="50%" height="50%"/>

I was struck by how the prompt generated images of framed paintings hung in galleries. However, the use of terms for psychiatric diagnoses in the prompt lead back into the territory of the earlier "gene for…" experiments. Would constructing prompts based on symptoms be constructive?:

{% assign history = site.pages | where: "title", "History of Art" %}
In many of the images the the figures depicted are looking at art, making it, or becoming part of it. More of this series can be viewed in the [History of Art]({{ history[0].url }}) gallery.
